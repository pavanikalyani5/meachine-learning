You two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words 'Cause you can hear it in the silence You can feel it on the way home You can see it with the lights out You are in love, true love You are in love! You can hear it in the silence, silence, you You can feel it on the way home, way home, you You can see it with the lights out, lights out You are in love, true love You are in love You can hear it in the silence, silence, you You can feel it on the way home, way home, you You can see it with the lights out, lights out You are in love, true love You are in love\n",
